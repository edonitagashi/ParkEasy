# ParkEasy – Parking App Prototype

**Technology:** Node.js + Expo/React Native  

This project, developed by third-year Computer Engineering students at FIEK, is a prototype of a mobile parking management app. It provides screen views for navigation between locations, searching for parking spots, saving favorite spots, and managing the user profile for now.

## Project Description

ParkEasy is a mobile app prototype built using Node.js and Expo/React Native. Currently, it does **not** connect to a database (e.g., Firebase) but demonstrates the UI and screen navigation.

The app features four main sections in a tab bar:

- **Nearby** – Displays a map with nearby parking spots.  
- **Search** – Allows users to search for specific parking spots.  
- **Favorites** – Saves frequently used or favorite parking spots.  
- **Profile** – Shows user information and additional options like Settings, Help, About Us.  

## Key Functionalities

- **Nearby Map:** Display of parking spots on a map with the option to save locations.  
- **Search Parking:** Search for parking spots by name or location.  
- **Favorites:** List of favorite parking spots for easy access.  
- **Profile Management:** View user information and access additional options (Settings, Help, About Us).  
- **Navigation:** Tab bar allows quick switching between the four main sections.  

## How to Run the Prototype
