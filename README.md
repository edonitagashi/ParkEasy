ParkEasy is a comprehensive mobile parking management application developed as part of the **Mobile Application Programming** course at FIEK (Faculty of Computer Engineering and Information Technology). This project implements essential mobile development concepts and best practices, including Firebase integration, real-time data synchronization, role-based authentication, and modern UI/UX design.

Throughout the course, we have implemented some of the most important tasks and features required for mobile application development. In the final phase, we focused on critical improvements including map functionality fixes, notification system implementation, image picker enhancements, UI animation refinements, and comprehensive testing to ensure a polished, production-ready application.
